# Yata

> Self-hosted dashboard for monitoring your stats across all your private trackers — one page, one binary, your data stays yours.

![Dashboard](docs/screenshots/dashboard-grid.png)

Yata pulls your stats from each tracker's **API** (and, where the operator permits it, politely fills the gaps from your profile page), stores everything in a local SQLite database, and shows it all on one dashboard: unified stats, group/rank progress, promotion targets, trends, alerts, and estimated invite routes to trackers you don't have yet.

**Status: public beta.** It works, it's been running against real trackers for months, and feedback is very welcome — see [Feedback & beta notes](#feedback--beta-notes).

> **⚠️ Protect your `config.json`.** Yata stores your tracker **API keys and session cookies in plain text** in `config.json` (next to the binary, or in `./data` under Docker). Anyone who can read that file can act as you on your trackers. Lock it down like a password file — restrict its permissions and never share or commit it — and take extra care on **shared boxes such as seedboxes**. See [Your data and security](#your-data-and-security) before you start.

## Why Yata

- **Private by design.** Runs entirely on your own machine/server. The only network requests it ever makes are to *your* trackers with *your* credentials, plus any integrations you explicitly configure (webhooks, qui, Prowlarr). No telemetry, no analytics, no phoning home.
- **API first, always.** API data is authoritative. Profile scraping only fills stats the API doesn't provide, and both are merged into ONE stats view per tracker (with an optional per-stat origin dot so you can see where each number came from).
- **Respect the trackers.** Scraping is rate-limited with a hard 60-minute floor that cannot be lowered. Tracker operators can request stricter limits — or forbid scraping entirely — in their definition file, and those requests always win. There's an API-only mode, and an opt-out list for sites that don't want to be supported at all.
- **Trackers are data, not code.** Every tracker is a JSON file in `defs/trackers/`. Adding or fixing a tracker never touches the app; tracker staff can own their definition.

## Feature tour

### One dashboard, every tracker

Grid or table, your choice. Cards show unified stats, styled group badges with the tracker's own rank icons, perk lists, active event banners (freeleech etc.), account age, and live progress toward your targets. Hover a stat for its recent per-day trend ("≈ 245.3 GiB per day"); the dot next to each value shows whether it came from the API or a profile scrape.

![Detail table](docs/screenshots/dashboard-table.png)

### Targets & promotions

Load targets straight from a rank's real requirements ("Load from Group"), or set your own. Progress bars, time estimates from your recent growth, and full support for either/or requirements — e.g. Anthelion's *"5 uploads and/or 10 adoptions"*:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/card-targets.png" width="420" alt="Targets with one-of requirements"></p>

Requirements and estimates are guidance for planning, not guarantees — always check the tracker's own promotion rules.

### History — see your growth

A dedicated view over the months of stats Yata records for every tracker. Pick a metric, overlay one or many trackers in their own colours, and choose a range from 48 hours to all-time. Hover for a crosshair readout, or click to pin two points for an exact delta and per-day rate. Switch between cumulative **Value** and **Rate/day**, add a **Σ Portfolio** line summing your trackers, or turn on a dashed **projection** tail. With a single tracker selected, its targets (yours or its group's) are drawn as reference lines — so you can watch your trajectory close on the goal:

### Pathways — where can I go from here?

Estimated invite routes from the trackers you have to the one you want, powered by the community [trackerpathways](https://github.com/handokota/trackerpathways) dataset (MIT). The first hop is evaluated against your live stats — including the full class-requirement breakdown — and later hops use community estimates. Tracker-specific invite rules that the community data misses (e.g. MyAnonamouse's separate invite-forum requirements) are layered in from the tracker's definition, clearly marked:

![Pathways](docs/screenshots/pathways.png)

### Alerts & notifications

Webhook notifications to Discord, Telegram, Gotify, or any generic JSON endpoint. Build rules from conditions (ratio below X, hit & run appears, tracker unreachable, a freeleech/event banner goes up — the banner text is passed through), scope them to specific trackers, and set cooldowns. Rules are evaluated on the server every few minutes, so alerts fire even with no browser open. Webhook URLs are hidden in the UI once saved, and the alerts export strips secrets so you can share your setup safely.

![Alerts](docs/screenshots/settings-alerts.png)

### Polite scraping, transparent policy

The dashboard shows exactly why any scrape is blocked and when the next one is allowed. Limits are enforced server-side and survive restarts.

![Scraping settings](docs/screenshots/settings-scraping.png)

The effective interval is the **maximum** of every layer — nothing can undercut a stricter layer above it:

| Layer | Set by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hard floor | the app | 60 min — cannot be lowered by anyone |
| Global setting | you (Settings → Scraping) | default 120 min (floor 60) |
| Tracker type def | software def file | rarely used |
| Tracker def | **tracker operator** | e.g. "≥ 120 min, max 6/day" |
| Per-tracker setting | you (tracker edit) | can only make it stricter |

The daily cap takes the most restrictive non-zero value, and an operator's `disable_scraping` can never be overridden. Trackers on the opt-out list (`defs/optout.json`) cannot be added at all.

### Themes & display

Thirteen built-in themes plus a live preview of every display option. Drop your own `.css` in `static/themes/` to add more — override only the variables you want.

![Display settings](docs/screenshots/settings-display.png)

Tracker rank icons use the same Font Awesome classes the tracker sites themselves use. If you own Font Awesome Pro, drop it into `static/fontawesome/` (`css/all.min.css` + `webfonts/`) and you'll see the real icons; without it, Pro-only icons automatically fall back to a free icon — nothing breaks.

### And the rest

- **Connectivity test** per tracker — one click tells you whether the API, the scrape cookie, or both are working, and why not
- **48-hour sparklines** and aggregate trend cards
- **Login protection** — optional single-user auth (bcrypt + sessions) for instances reachable beyond localhost, with brute-force lockout
- **Backups & portability** — one-click config export/import (with automatic pre-import backup), opt-in scheduled backups, tracker history CSV export
- **Rolling log viewer** — live logs in Settings for troubleshooting and bug reports; query strings never reach the log
- **qui integration** — live qBittorrent stat bars via [qui](https://github.com/autobrr/qui)
- **Read-only API tokens** — let homelab dashboards (Homepage, Homarr), Grafana, or scripts read your stats without your login; tokens can't change anything or see credentials. See the [API reference](docs/API.md)
- **Prowlarr / Jackett import** — pull your indexer list straight from either manager, including stored API keys (both) and session cookies (Jackett), so trackers arrive ready to fetch and scrape
- **Demo tracker** — explore the whole UI safely with mock data, no credentials needed

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended)

Drop this `docker-compose.yml` next to wherever you want Yata's data to live, then `docker compose up -d`:

```yaml
services:
  yata:
    image: ghcr.io/yata-dash/yata:latest
    container_name: yata
    ports:
      - "8420:8420"          # then open http://<host>:8420
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data         # config.json + database — back up this folder
    environment:
      - TZ=Etc/UTC           # optional: your timezone, e.g. Australia/Brisbane
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
# → http://localhost:8420
```

Only `./data` has to persist (your config + database); mount `./defs` and `./static/themes` too if you want to edit tracker definitions or drop in custom themes live. Update with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

> **New to Docker?** You don't need Go, Node, or a repo checkout — Docker pulls a ready-to-run image. `docker compose up -d` starts it in the background; `docker compose logs -f` shows what it's doing; `docker compose down` stops it (your `./data` stays). That's the whole loop.

*Prefer to build the image yourself?* Clone the repo and use the bundled compose with `build: .` instead of the published image — `git clone https://github.com/Yata-Dash/Yata-Dash && cd Yata-Dash && docker compose up -d`.

### From source

Prerequisites: [Go 1.23+](https://go.dev/dl/) and [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/).

```powershell
# Windows
.\build.ps1 -Run
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS
make build && ./yata
```

### Port / address / paths

```
yata --port 9000 --host 127.0.0.1     # flags win
YATA_PORT=9000 yata                # then environment
config.json → { "server": { ... } }      # then config
```

Also: `--config`, `--data` (SQLite file), `--defs`, `--base`, `--log` — each with a `YATA_*` env equivalent.

## Setting up

### Your data and security

**Read this first.** Yata keeps everything in two files, next to the binary (or in `./data` under Docker):

- **`config.json`** — your trackers, settings, and **credentials**. Your tracker **API keys and session cookies are stored in plain text** in this file. Anyone who can read it can act as you on every tracker you've added.
- **`yata.db`** — stats, history, and login sessions.

**Treat `config.json` like a password file:**

- Restrict its permissions so only you can read it (`chmod 600 config.json` on Linux/macOS; under Docker keep the `./data` volume private).
- Never commit it to git, paste it into a bug report, or share it — the config export in Settings → General strips webhook secrets for sharing, but the raw `config.json` does **not**.
- Be especially careful on **shared or multi-user boxes such as seedboxes**: anyone who can read your home directory can read your tracker credentials. If you can't lock the file down there, prefer **API-only** setups (an API key alone, no session cookie) and rotate/revoke keys you no longer use.

Both files are yours to back up and move (export/import from Settings → General) — just treat every backup as the bundle of credentials it is.

### Add your trackers

1. Open **Settings → Trackers → Add Tracker** and pick your tracker from the list (or enter any base URL — trackers without a definition still work for all API stats).
2. Paste your **API key** (usually tracker profile → API/Security settings; the form shows a tracker-specific hint where we have one).
3. *Optional, for extra stats:* add your **username** and **session cookie** to enable profile scraping for the stats the API doesn't expose (seed size, average seed time, and friends). Log in to the tracker → DevTools (F12) → copy the cookie header. Trackers that report no join date will ask you to enter it once, for account-age tracking.
4. Hit **Test** — it tells you immediately whether the API and the scrape each work, and what's missing if not.

### If your instance is reachable from outside localhost

Yata binds to `0.0.0.0` by default (so Docker/LAN/Tailscale setups just work) and will warn you at startup and in the UI: **anyone who can reach the port has full access until you enable login protection** (Settings → General → Account). Sessions are httpOnly cookies; five failed logins lock the IP for 15 minutes. If you ever lose the password, the reset path deliberately wipes all config and data — a stolen box can't be pried open that way. Put it behind a reverse proxy with TLS if you expose it beyond your LAN.

## For tracker staff

Yata is built to be a good citizen, and definitions are designed so **you** stay in control:

- Your definition file (`defs/trackers/yours.json`) carries your **rate-limit requests** (`min_interval_minutes`, `max_scrapes_per_day`) and they override every user setting — or set `disable_scraping: true` and Yata will never touch a profile page on your site.
- Prefer not to be supported at all? One entry in `defs/optout.json` blocks your tracker from being added, with a message shown to the user.
- Every definition records `last_updated` and `approved_by` (staff name/role/date) so support stays accountable and current.
- API-first means a user with an API key generates exactly the same load as any API consumer you already allow — scraping only exists to fill the gaps your API leaves, at a floor of once per hour.
- **Yata identifies its traffic** so you can monitor it: by default every request (API and scrape) carries a `Yata/<version>` User-Agent suffix — one `grep Yata access.log` tells you exactly what the app does on your site, and a one-line nginx/WAF rule can rate-limit or block it. Your def's `identify` field can switch this to an `X-Yata-Version` header (if your session security dislikes UA changes) or disable it (if your bot protection would challenge it).

Questions, corrections, or requests — please open an issue.

## Bundled tracker definitions

Any trackers not approved should only be used in API only mode until approval has been confirmed. A warning will appear in app.
If you are a tracker not on this list please reach out.
If you are a tracker on this list and wish to approve or ask to opt out entirely, please reach out. 

| Tracker | Platform | Approved by tracker | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aither | Unit3D | No | Awaiting approval - New Upload groups note yet added, Monthly Uploads not retrevable |
| Anthelion | Gazelle | No |  |
| Huno | Unit3D | No | API Only - Not on this tracker can't seek approval |
| InfinityHD | Unit3D | Yes | 60min scrape limit |
| LST | Unit3D | No |  |
| Luminarr | Unit3D | No |  |
| MyAnonamouse | Custom | Yes | API ONLY |
| Oldtoons | Unit3D | Yes | API ONLY - Added all required stats to API (THANK YOU!) |
| OnlyEncodes+ | Unit3D | No | Awaiting approval  |
| RetroFlix | Custom | No | Scrape only - No useful API stats |
| Seedpool | Unit3D | Yes | 180min scrape limit |
| YUSCENE | Unit3D | Pending |  |
| Zenith | Unit3D | Yes | Will switch to API only when extended stats added |

  — plus a credential-free demo tracker. Definitions include the full group ladders (colors, icons, promotion requirements incl. either/or paths, perks) where the tracker publishes them.

**OldToonsWorld is fully API-supported:** its staff added an API endpoint that exposes every stat Yata tracks — including seed size, seed times, and unread mail/notification flags — so Yata reads everything from the API and does **no** profile scraping for it. It's the model we hope more trackers follow (UNIT3D is rolling out richer stats APIs); when they do, a tracker can be added to Yata with an API key alone, no session cookie.

Adding one is a JSON file away: copy `defs/templates/tracker.template.jsonc` (every field documented) to `defs/trackers/<key>.json`, strip comments, then **Settings → Trackers → Reload Definitions**. Defs that fail to parse are skipped and reported — they never crash the app.

## Feedback & beta notes

This is a beta: expect rough edges, report anything odd. The most useful reports include the **three versions** from Settings → General (app, definitions, pathways — click *Check for updates* to see if any are out of date; a stale defs/pathways version is often the cause), your tracker + whether API/scrape/test work (Settings → Trackers → Test), and a snippet from Settings → Logs.

Especially interested in: trackers whose stats parse wrong, group ladders that drifted from the def, promotion/pathway estimates that disagree with reality, and anything a tracker operator wants changed about how their site is handled.
