# Changelog

All notable changes to Yata, newest first. Versions are date-based builds:
`Beta-YYYYMMDD[letter]`.

How this is used: jot changes under **Unreleased** as you work. When you cut a
release (dev.ps1 → *Cut a release*), move the Unreleased notes under a new
version heading — those notes become the GitHub Release body automatically.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Hawke-uno (HUNO) support** — API-only via their custom `/api/profile`
  endpoint (Bearer auth). Seed-division bracket counts (Vanguard → Legend +
  Guardian) show as HUNO-exclusive stats on cards and in the Detail view, and
  all six user groups are defined with their bracket promotion requirements.
- **`min_counts` group requirements** — defs can now express "N torrents in a
  per-tracker counter" promotion rules (e.g. HUNO's seed-time brackets), shown
  as live progress bars in Targets. Rendered straight from the def like
  `any_of`, in def order.
- **Unread mail/notification icons in the Detail view's collapsed rows**, next
  to the event beacon — same at-a-glance icons as grid cards, following the
  same Display toggles.
- Custom-API trackers that report a join date (like HUNO's `member_since`) no
  longer ask you to enter one manually; ISO datetimes are trimmed to a date and
  an infinite ratio (`"Inf"` at zero download) renders as ∞.
- **Long-range history foundation** (groundwork for the upcoming History view):
  daily history rollups are now kept ~2 years instead of 35 days (configurable
  via `history_daily_retention_days`; ~150 KB per tracker per year), and a new
  `GET /api/history/series` endpoint serves filtered per-tracker/per-field
  series with automatic fine-vs-daily granularity. The existing 48 h sparklines
  and 14-day fine history are unchanged.
- **PWA manifest** — Yata can now be installed as an app from the browser
  (mobile home screen / desktop). No offline caching: live stats stay live.
- Configurable idle **API auto-refresh interval** (Settings → Scraping; default
  30 min, floor 15) and a **qui bar refresh rate** (Settings → Integrations;
  default 10 s). A server-side min-age guard coalesces background refreshes,
  open dashboards, and page reloads into ~one API call per interval; the manual
  refresh button and Tracker Test always bypass it.
- **Runtime enforcement of tracker opt-outs** — a tracker added to
  `defs/optout.json` after it was configured now stops all API + scrape traffic
  immediately, with a clear badge in the Trackers list (previously only blocked
  at add-time).
- **UNIT3D extended-stats API support** — trackers that expose `/api/user/stats`
  (e.g. OldToonsWorld) now serve seed size, seed times, FL tokens, invites,
  warnings, real up/down/ratio, and unread flags via the API, so scraping can be
  turned off entirely for them.
- Developer helper **`dev.ps1`** — a menu to run the project tools (API probe,
  pathways sync/check, versions), bump the app version, and commit/cut releases.

### Changed
- **Add Tracker is now just the basics** — the Targets section moved out of the
  add flow (set targets from the dashboard's pencil or the edit screen), and
  the session-cookie field only appears when it's actually usable (hidden for
  API-only trackers unless their API authenticates with it).
- **Targets editor redesigned** (edit screen): selecting a target group shows a
  clean read-only chip summary of its requirements instead of greyed-out
  inputs; choosing "manual" opens a builder where you add one row per target,
  picking from every stat the tracker actually reports — including newer and
  tracker-specific stats (FL tokens, upload snatches, HUNO's seed brackets, …),
  which now render as progress bars on the dashboard too.
- UNIT3D API requests now use **Bearer auth**, keeping your API token out of the
  tracker's URL access logs, with an automatic `?api_token=` fallback for older
  instances.
- The **pathways version** now reflects the upstream *data* date rather than the
  date it was fetched, so it no longer looks newer than it is.

### Fixed
- **Icons no longer render as boxes with a partial self-hosted Font Awesome
  kit.** If some `webfonts/*.woff2` files are missing (e.g. Light/Thin never
  copied), the affected styles are detected at load, their icons swap to the
  free fallback, and Settings → Display shows exactly which files to copy.
  A fully broken kit re-enables the bundled free icon set automatically.
- The login **username is now case-insensitive** (the password stays exact).
- Deleting a tracker now also removes its daily history rollups (previously
  they lingered in the database).

### Security
- The README now prominently documents that tracker API keys and session cookies
  are stored in plain text in `config.json`, with guidance for shared/seedbox
  setups.
